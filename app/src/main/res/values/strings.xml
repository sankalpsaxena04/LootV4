Between an ongoing mission, you can also challenge any other online player for a duel in a mini game by placing a bet of coins of your choice. Your opponent can either accept or reject your challenge. If he/she chooses to accept, they also get to choose a bet of the equal number or coins as you, or less. The lesser number of coins will be the final bet placed. Your number of coins will decide your rank on the leaderboard. At the end of 2 days of the event going live, the top players on the leaderboard will be declared winners. Happy looting!</string>
